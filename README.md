# kernel-modules

A repository of my personal projects developing and testing Kernel Modules for the Ubuntu OS running in a VM.

Modules:

  1.) Simple Kernel Module that prints hello world to the kernel log.
  
  2.) Prints a list of each running process to the kernel log.
  
  3.) IN PROGRESS - Character Device module.
  

Inpsiration and reference for the code is from _Linux Device Drivers_, 3rd Edition. Freely available here: https://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/
